# Goal
Given the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. Can clustering similar research articles together simplify the search for related publications? How can the content of the clusters be qualified?

By using clustering for labelling in combination with dimensionality reduction for visualization, the collection of literature can be represented by a scatter plot. On this plot, publications of highly similar topic will share a label and will be plotted near each other. In order, to find meaning in the clusters, topic modelling will be performed to find the keywords of each cluster.

# Approach:
- Parse the text from the body of each document using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Turn each document instance $d_i$ into a feature vector $X_i$ using Term Frequencyâ€“inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- Apply Dimensionality Reduction to each feature vector $X_i$ using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to cluster similar research articles in the two dimensional plane $X$ embedding $Y_1$.
- Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project down the dimensions of $X$ to a number of dimensions that will keep .95 variance while removing noise and outliers in embedding $Y_2$.
- Apply k-means clustering on $Y_2$, where $k$ is 20, to label each cluster on $Y_1$.
- Apply Topic Modeling on $X$ using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover keywords from each cluster. 
- Investigate the clusters visually on the plot, zooming down to specific articles as needed, and via classification using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
